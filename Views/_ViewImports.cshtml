@* _ViewImports.cshtml - This file is automatically included in every view
   It sets up things we want available everywhere like tag helpers and namespaces *@

@* This makes our Models namespace available in all views without typing the full path *@
@using CarInsurance
@using CarInsurance.Models

@* Tag helpers let us use HTML-like syntax for things like form fields and links
   For example: <label asp-for="FirstName"> instead of Html.LabelFor(...) *@
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
